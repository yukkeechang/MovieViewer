# Project 1 - *MovieViewer3*

**Name of your app** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ ] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to use the search function
2. Making images fade in when they load (basically both optional features)
